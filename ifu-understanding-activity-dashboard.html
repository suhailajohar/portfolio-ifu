<h1>Understanding Your Activity Dashboard</h1>
<h2>Wellness Activity Monitor</h2>

<hr>

<h3>1. Purpose</h3>
<p>
This document explains how to review and interpret weekly activity data
displayed in the companion mobile application dashboard.
</p>

<h3>2. Overview</h3>
<p>
The activity dashboard summarizes recorded physical activity data collected
by the Wellness Activity Monitor. The dashboard is designed to support user
awareness of personal activity patterns over time.
</p>

<h3>3. Weekly Activity Summary</h3>
<p>
The dashboard provides a weekly summary of recorded activity, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Total step count</li>
  <li>Active minutes</li>
  <li>Estimated calorie expenditure</li>
</ul>

<p>
Weekly summaries allow users to observe trends rather than focusing on
single-day values.
</p>

<h3>4. Interpreting Activity Levels</h3>
<p>
General physical activity guidance published by the World Health Organization
(WHO) recommends that adults engage in regular physical activity as part of a
healthy lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
The activity dashboard presents recorded data for informational purposes only.
Users are encouraged to interpret trends in the context of their personal
goals and daily routines.
</p>

<div class="caution">
<strong>CAUTION</strong><br>
Activity data displayed in the dashboard is informational and should not be
used as a substitute for professional medical advice or clinical assessment.
</div>

<h3>5. Understanding Weekly Trends</h3>
<p>
Weekly trend views illustrate changes in activity levels over time. Viewing
data across multiple weeks may help users identify consistent patterns, such
as increased or decreased activity during specific periods.
</p>

<p>
Short-term fluctuations are normal and may occur due to changes in routine,
device wear time, or daily activities.
</p>

<h3>6. Dashboard Indicators</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Indicator</th>
    <th>Description</th>

    <td>Daily Average</td>
    <td>

      within a selected week
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Weekly Total</td>
    <td>
      Represents the cumulative activity recorded across a seven-day period

  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>7. Limitations of the Data</h3>
<p>
Recorded activity data may be influenced by factors such as device placement,
wear duration, and user movement patterns. The dashboard does not account for
all forms of physical activity.
</p>

<h3>8. Additional Information</h3>
<p>
For further guidance on physical activity, users may refer to publicly
available resources provided by recognized health organizations.
